# ASSESSMENT 5: Ruby Coding Practical Questions
# MINASWAN

# --------------------1) Create a method that takes in an array of words and a single letter and returns all the words that contain that particular letter.

beverages_array = ['coffee', 'tea', 'juice', 'water', 'soda water']
letter_o = 'o'
# Expected output: ['coffee', 'soda water']
letter_t = 't'
# Expected output: ['tea', 'water', 'soda water']

# PSEUDO CODE:
# Create medhod called wordReturn --> (array, letter)
# Use .select on the array to filter through the elements in the array
# return(implicitly) if value includes the supplied letter using .include? and passing in letter

def wordReturn (array, letter)
    array.select{|value| value.include?(letter)}
end

p wordReturn beverages_array, letter_o
p wordReturn beverages_array, letter_t


# -------------------2) Create a method that takes in an array of numbers and returns the sum of the numbers. Use the test variables provided.

nums_array1 = [42, 7, 27]
# Expected output: 76

nums_array2 = [25, 17, 47, 11]
# Expected output: 100

# PSEUDO CODE:
# Create method called "additionBot" --> (array)
# implicit return & use built-in .sum on the array 

def additionBot array
    array.sum
end

p additionBot nums_array1
p additionBot nums_array2

# --------------------3a) Create a class called Bike that is initialized with a model, wheels, and current_speed. The default number of wheels is 2. The current_speed should start at 0. Create a bike_info method that returns a sentence with all the data from the bike object.

# Expected output example: 'The Trek bike has 2 wheels and is going 0 mph.'



# -------------------3b) Add the ability to pedal faster and brake. The pedal_faster method should increase the speed by a given amount. The brake method should decrease the speed by a given amount. The bike cannot go negative speeds.

# Expected output example: my_bike.pedal_faster(10) => 10
# Expected output example: my_bike.pedal_faster(18) => 28
# Expected output example: my_bike.brake(5) => 23
# Expected output example: my_bike.brake(25) => 0
